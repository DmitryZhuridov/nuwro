<h1>NuWro documentation</h1>


<h2>New parameters format</h2>
The default parameters format has changed in nuwro as well as source layout.
<p>
The params.txt file now includes predefined bream  and target configurations
from the beam an target folders respactively.
This make the usage of nuwro easier. 
<p>
Some new feature include mixed meams, mixed target and detector geometry
for the ND280 detector.
The detectr geometry is definced in the file <b>target/ND280.root</b> used by 
writing 
<p>
<tt>@target/ND280.txt</tt>
</p>
This should be acompenied by using <tt>@beam/ND280.txt</tt>
which just specifies: 
<p>
<tt>beam_type=2</tt>
<p>
in order to use beam files generated by jnubeam software. Note that the files whould be dowloaded 
separetely a symlink called flux should be created poinint at the directory where the beam root files 
are stored. Nuwro will loop over all the files in the folder.
<p>



<h2>Form factors</h2>
A case must be taken with regards to the new formfactors parameter.
when using the new quasi elastic implementation <p><b>qel_new=1</b><p> one specifies the form factors 
with the <b>sf_ff_set</b> parameter: 
<h2>Detector geometry</h2>
